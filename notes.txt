## What I'd like from an AOC starter:
- a script like "aoc-setup <day-number>"
    - makes a directory for <day-number>
    - downloads the input file (can't, the input is different per user)
    - makes a new .ts file where I would write into
    - sets up tests (?)
- a script that compiles and runs the .ts file.
- a script like "test" that would run tests
    - maybe a nodemon watcher that would keep running tests live
